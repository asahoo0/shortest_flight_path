without writing code. We decided to meet Monday and Thursday in person. We decided

to research and plan how to implement BFS and Dijkstra's.

Week of 11/14 - We started data acquisition and processing this week using the airport

and route classes. We ran into problems with the make ﬁle not compiling so we planned

how to solve this. We decided to put everything in the graph class.

Week of 11/21 - We completed data acquisition. We also made tests and edited the

BFS. We had problems with the larger airport data.

Week of 11/28 - We ﬁnished up the BFS algorithm and created a main.cpp. In the

second half of the week we used Dijkstra’s Algorithm to get paths between airports

using distance. We added tests for BFS to verify its correctness.

Week of 12/5 - We ﬁnished up Dijkstra's Algorithm and started working on the

visualization for the project. We added a world map and added all the dots for the

airport. We ran into some problems with getting the CS225 folder to work with the

building of our project but we were able to get them ﬁxed.

Week of 12/12 - We ﬁnished up our graphical implementation and were able to draw a

route between stops and endpoints based on the Djikstra’s implementation. We also

added a main method that took user input. Additionally, we added comments for our

graph class and deleted any dead code. We made a presentation and recording for our

project. We also tried to ﬁnish up results.md with proof of our project working.
