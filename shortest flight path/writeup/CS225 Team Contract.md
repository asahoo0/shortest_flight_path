***Team Members: Daniel Keegan (dkeegan2), Sahil Armaan Kumar (sahilak2), Runqi Shi (runqis2),***

***Aishani Sahoo(asahoo4)***

**Communication:**

**1. Team Meetings:** Our team will meet twice a week on Monday and Thursday from 6-7pm on

Zoom. We will rotate note takers, starting from sahilak2, and the notetaker will take notes on

whatever software they prefer and upload it to a Google document after the meeting concludes.

**2. Assistance:** We will be using groupme, Zoom, and email to communicate. An email should be

responded to within 24 hours during business days (M-F). Groupme messages should be replied

to urgently or within a few hours and be used to communicate smaller bits of information unlike

an email.

**3. Respect:** We will begin each meeting with a discussion of new ideas that each member of the

group may have, and continue with a feedback session for constructive criticism of these ideas.

After this session, we will have each member discuss the progress they have made towards the

project since the previous week. Decisions will be taken based on a majority basis, only being

accepted if at least 3 of the 4 group members agree to a decision. If someone feels like they are

not being given a chance to speak in a group discussion, they will raise their hand at the zoom

meeting and this will signal it is their turn to speak.

**Collaboration:**

**1. Work Distribution:** We will determine the weekly objectives during our Monday meetings. We

will discuss our work towards those goals on Thursday. Work will be distributed on Mondays.

There will be no pattern for weekly distribution of work, but as a team we agreed to each pull our

own weight and speak up if one person feels another is not pulling their weight. For version

control purposes, typically one person will work on a function at a time and may ask for

assistance from group members if need be.

**2. Time Commitment:** Each person is responsible for two to six hours of work. If an assigned

function takes longer than that, the group should be informed and work should be redistributed if

possible. If there is a situation where work cannot be redistributed as everyone has already spent

six hours, the objective should be moved to the following week. If a team member habitually

doesn’t complete tasks, they should be asked to explain their circumstances and staff members

will be informed if other members deem it necessary.


**3. Conflict Resolution:** If there is a disagreement between team members on any basis, we will call

a team vote and resolve the conflict by virtue of a majority (3 or more team members being in

agreement). Members who are not adhering to the standards laid out in this document will be

politely asked to explain their circumstances, and if the other three team members unanimously

decide that a staff member is needed to intervene, then we will alert one.
